This repo contains the files that I'll be using for my introductory data science in R group.

Week 0 itinerary


Week 0.5 itinerary

Due to some last minute cancels, Ben and I just worked on mapping out some ACA data that he found. We did some basic data import/cleaning and then did some cool graphing in geom_map which I had never used before. I later added an interactive leaftlet map that we can play around with later.


Week 1 itinerary

- Review pulling files via command line.
- Review the basics of rStudio/R files.
- Go through data setup/ visualizations, create a new one from scratch.
- Facet graphs
- Gather and Spread -- uses in data and visualizations.

Midweek exercises if you want to review/want some more visualization practice: [Chapter 3 of R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)
