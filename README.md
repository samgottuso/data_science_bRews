This repo contains the files that I'll be using for my introductory data science in R group.

Week 1 itinerary

- Review pulling files via command line.
- Review the basics of rStudio/R files.
- Go through data setup/ visualizations, create a new one from scratch.
- Facet graphs
- Gather and Spread -- uses in data and visualizations.

Midweek exercises if you want to review/want some more visualization practice: [Chapter 3 of R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)
